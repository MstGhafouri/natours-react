### A MERN Stack web-app

**This project is build using modern technologies**:

- `React & Redux`
- `Node & Express`
- `MongoDB & Mongoose`
- `Semantic ui react`
- `Sass`
- And more!

I've built this app based on [Jonas Schmedtmann](https://github.com/jonasschmedtmann) node bootcamp course (one of the best udemy courses!).

**This project consists of a lot of modern and advanced features like**:
- [x] User authentication & authorization (`jsonWebToken`, `password reset`, ...)
- [x] Stripe `payment`
- [x] Sending `emails` with Sendgrid
- [x] Advanced `seaching`, `filtering` and `pagination`
- [x] `Drag & drop`, `cropping` and `uploading` images
- [x] `Admin CRUD operations` for managing users
- [ ] Advanced authentication (`confirm user email`, `refresh tokens`, ...) soon!
- [ ] And more...!

I'm continuously improving this project; 
There are a lot more features to add, and it can be improved much more.
