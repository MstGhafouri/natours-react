### A MERN Stack web-app üòé

**This project is built using modern technologies**:

- `Node & Express`
- `MongoDB & Mongoose`
- `Docker & docker-compose`
- `React & Redux`
- `Semantic ui react`
- `Sass`
- And more!

I've built this app based on [Jonas Schmedtmann](https://github.com/jonasschmedtmann) node bootcamp course (one of the best udemy courses!).

**This project consists of a lot of modern and advanced features like**:

- [x] User authentication & authorization (`jsonWebToken`, `password reset`, ...)
- [x] Advanced authentication (`confirm user email`)
- [x] Stripe `payment`
- [x] Sending `emails` with Sendgrid
- [x] Advanced `searching`, `filtering` and `pagination`
- [x] `Drag & drop`, `cropping` and `uploading` images
- [x] `Admin CRUD operations` for managing users
- [x] Integrating `Mapbox` in react
- [ ] And more...!

If you enjoyed this app, don't forget to give a ‚≠ê.
